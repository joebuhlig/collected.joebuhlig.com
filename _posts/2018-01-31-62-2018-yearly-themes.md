Looking back on 2017, I realized I was in a similar boat as [Grey](http://www.cgpgrey.com/). The year was chaotic in many ways. But I'm not one to do yearly themes (though I've considered it many times) so adopting *The Year of Order* isn't something I'll do. But I do like his catch phrase for it, "The work isn't the work. The system is the work." It's very similar to the concept of building habits instead of projects. I can get behind that.
