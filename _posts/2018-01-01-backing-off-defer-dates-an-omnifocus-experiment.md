I’ve always admired [David’s](https://www.macsparky.com) devotion to defer dates in [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus). But it seems he’s playing around with flagging items from a larger list instead of trying to complete everything available to him on a given day. I’m looking forward to his end result post on this one.
