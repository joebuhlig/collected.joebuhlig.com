It’s a long story but I’m finally getting back into listening to podcasts and not just recording them. And [Hurry Slowly](http://hurryslowly.co) is one of my favorites that I’m catching up on. This particular episode struck me as [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com) explains his methods of pointing his attention where he wants and when he wants. All I can say is that I’m jealous, but at the same time wondering what to do about it.
