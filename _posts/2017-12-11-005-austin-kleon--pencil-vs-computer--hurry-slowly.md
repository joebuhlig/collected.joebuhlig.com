I feel like I’m linking to [Hurry Slowly](http://hurryslowly.co) a lot lately. [Jocelyn](http://jkglei.com) does an excellent job of verbalizing exactly what I’m thinking about a lot of topics revolving around technology and headspace. This one is especially memorable for me. [Austin Kleon](http://jkglei.com) joins to talk about the intersection of analog and digital tools, a topic I’m quite enamored with.
